# Calhacks Pharmaceutical waste LLM 
This repository contains the code and the CSV file used to eventually simplify the process of disposing of pharmaceutical waste. Through various techniques such as sentence and vectorization, we have compiled the data to eventually be used in an app where the user could enter specific characteristics and active ingredients and receive the proper disposal method would be useful for people throughout the industry. The approved EPA and FDA data is integrated with the ChatGpt3.5-turbo model for the user accesibility. All the user needs to input is natural text about their problem. Ideally, The app would have an image recognition tool to classify pills through photos and a feature to order a disposal team directly to the user's location.Unfortuantely, due to the lengthy process of approved access by the California State Government. All included Data have been vetted by a medical waste and pharmaceutical waste chemist.

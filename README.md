# Calhacks Pharmaceutical waste LLM 
This repository contains the code and the CSV file used to eventually simplify the process of disposing of pharmaceutical waste. Through various techniques such as tokenization and vectorization, we have compiled the data to eventually be used in an app where the user could enter specific characteristics and active ingredients and receive the proper disposal method would be useful for people throughout the industry. Ideally, The app would have an image recognition tool to classify pills through photos and a feature to order a disposal team directly to the user's location.

# Calhacks Pharmaceutical waste LLM 
This repository contains the code and the csv file used to eventually make the process of disposing of pharmacuetical waste simpler. Through various techniques such as tokenization and vectorization, we have compiled the data to eventually be used in an app where the user could enter specific characteristics and active ingredients and receive the proper disposal method would be useful for people throughout the industry. The app would also ideally have an image recognition tool to classify pills through photos and a feature to order a disposal team directly to the location of the user. 
# Data
